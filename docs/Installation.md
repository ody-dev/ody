Ody provides an example skeleton project that gets you up and running quickly. It comes pre-installed with
Eloquent as ORM. It is possible to implement Doctrine ORM or plain DBAL, check the database section in the sidebar.

```
composer create-project ody/framework project-name

cd project-name
php ody publish // publishes required config files
cp .env.example .env

php ody server:start
```

## Benchmarks

Real world benchmarks are in the works, the benchmark below was run on a workstation with an old first gen Ryzen 5 and
40GB ram.
The request went through all preconfigured middleware and fetched all users (25) from the database using Eloquent,
connection pooling
and controller caching was enabled.

```
$ wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:9501/users
